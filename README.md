# Hey there!

I'm E. Just E. I'm a technical writer and information developer. I morphed into this career by way of building NT servers in the early '90s to building networks, supporting software integrations, and migrating enterprise databases.

With each role I had to record the process, transfer the knowledge, and train my clients on the updates. I found I really enjoyed translating complex ideas into consumable content. Since I could speak geek as well as executive, I became the liaison for internal teams and end-users through my writing ability.

I **love** motorcycles, scuba, strength training, movies, good wine, nature, and my pets.
